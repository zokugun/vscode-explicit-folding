# Separator Rule

The properties `separator` and `separatorRegex` allow to fold a file based on a separator.

```
"cobol": {
	"separatorRegex": "(?<=^.{6}\\s{1,4})[A-Za-z0-9\\-_:]+(?=\\s+(?i:DIVISION))",
	"strict": "never",
	"nested": [
		{
			"separatorRegex": "(?<=^.{6}\\s{1,4})[A-Za-z0-9\\-_:]+(?=\\s+(?i:SECTION))"
		}
	]
}
```

## `foldBOF` property

The `foldBOF` property is a **boolean** (set to `true` by default).

If the value is `true`, the first separator will create a folding range from the beginning of the file to its first line.

## `foldEOF`

The `foldEOF` property is a **boolean** (set to `true` by default).

If the value is `true`, when the end of file is reached, the folding range will be closed on the last line.

## `kind`

The `kind` property indicates if the folding range is a `comment` or a `region` (set to `region` by default).

## `bypassProtection`

The `bypassProtection` property is a **boolean**.

If the value is `false`, by default, all **regex**es which are matching an empty string, are discarded. This is in order to protect against infinite loops.<br/>
If you want to match an empty line, you will need to disable the protection by setting this property to `true`.

## `autoFold`

The `autoFold` property is a **boolean** (set to `false` by default).

If the value is `true`, the folding range will be folded automatically.

## `nested`

The `nested` property is a **boolean** or an **array** of rules (set to `true` by default).

If the value is `true`, the existing folding range will allow nested folding ranges.<br/>
It the value is `false`, no new folding ranges can be created in the existing folding range (example: C/C++ block comment).

### nested rules

When the `nested` property is an **array**, it's listing the only rules you can find inside the folding region.

## `strict`

The `strict` property is a **boolean** or the **string** `never` (set to `true` by default). It's only relevant if the property `nested` is an array.

If the value is `true`, the rule can contain only folding regions directly defined in its property `nested`.<br/>
If the value is `false`, the rule can contain folding regions defined in its property `nested` or in the property `nested` of its children.<br/>
If the value is `never`, the default value of `strict` becomes `false` for itself and all its descendants.
